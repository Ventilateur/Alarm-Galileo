# Alarm-Galileo
Project video can be found here: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vnOxBL0f7k) </br>
This project uses library mraa provided by Intel: [libmraa](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/) </br>
I also use an additional Arduino for my distance sensor because my Intel Galileo has trouble in detecting both raising and falling edge (some of them can only detect one)
